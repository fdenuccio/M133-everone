# M133-Project - everone

1. Who?
2. What?
3. How?

1.
We have created a group of 4 members in class BI17b. Among them are the following team members: 
Francesco De Nuccio, Drilon Krasniqi, Alessio Benintende and Alexander Schwerzmann. 
With this grouping we can divide the tasks very well and are making good progress. 
As we have already proven our cooperation in various projects and this has always been positive.

2.
Our goal is that we create a website where you can log in and
then use our tool. We would like to create an online note platform, where
every user can take notes.

3.
Our preparation consists of creating a GitHub repository, all
team members and then upload the documents for our
Deposit website.

We created a mockup of the website:

# Documentation
## Archtecture
Our web page is simply built and consists of three layers:
Presentation layer that includes HTML and CSS.
Backend layer that includes PHP.
Data layer where we used a MySQL database.

## Technology
As previously mentioned we are using PHP which is easy to use and learn.
There have been many web pages that have used PHP.. However, it is slowly dying out and being replaced by C#, Javascript, Python etc.
One of the other reasons why we used PHP is that the teacher is familiar with the technology and could help us, if there was any need of it.

## Application design
### Flow
As you type in http://everone.me you will be redirected to our main page, index.php.
From there on you can choose between "Register" or "Login".
#### Registration
On the "Register" page you can create an account with information such as your username, e-mail and password. This will send your data to our database.
We want that the username to be unique, therefor if you enter an already existing user, it will warn you and not let you create a user.
