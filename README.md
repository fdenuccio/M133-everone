# M133-Project - everone

1. Who?
2. What?
3. How?

1.
We have created a group of 4 members in class BI17b. Among them are the following team members: 
Francesco De Nuccio, Drilon Krasniqi, Alessio Benintende and Alexander Schwerzmann. 
With this grouping we can divide the tasks very well and are making good progress. 
As we have already proven our cooperation in various projects and this has always been positive.

2.
Our goal is that we create a website where you can log in and
then can use our tool. We would like to create an online note platform, where
every user can take notes.

3.
Our preparation consists of creating a GitHub repository, all
team members and then upload the documents for our
Deposit website.

We created a mockup of the website:
